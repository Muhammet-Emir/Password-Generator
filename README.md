# Password-Generator
A Password Generator for use in the Python terminal.
## How Does It Work?
The program starts with a welcome screen in the terminal and asks user which language (English/Turkish) they prefer to use in Python's terminal. It asks if the user wants to continue, then asks for the conditions for the password user want to create. Here user decide on the length (10-128 characters), whether to use letters, numbers, and special characters. By selecting and combining these options, user can create the password user want. After the password is created, it is provided to the user along with a closing page, and there is an option for the user to create another password using the same rules. The passwords is created using Python's 'random' and 'string' libraries.
## Error Messages
If the user does something that causes the code to be incomplete or malfunction while using the program,
the program displays an error message and stops running if necessary.
## How Can It Be Improved ?
+Additional languages can be added to the language selection section or removed entirely. <br>
+The program can be set to save each password as history after creating it. <br>
+An interface can be added to make the program easier to understand and use. <br>
+Password security can be enhanced with an algorithm that checks the reliability level of the generated password.
