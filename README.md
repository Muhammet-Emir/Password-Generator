# Password-Generator
A Password Generator for use in the Python terminal.
## How Does It Work?
The program starts with a welcome screen in the terminal and asks the user which language (English/Turkish) they want to use in the Python terminal. It then asks the user if they want to continue and asks about the conditions for the password they want to create. Here, the user specifies the length of the password (10-128 characters) and whether they want to use letters, numbers, and special characters. By selecting and combining these options, the user can create the desired password. After the password is created, the user is presented with a closing page and given the option to create another password using the same rules. Passwords are created using Python's ‘random’ and ‘string’ libraries.
## Error Messages
If the user does something that causes the code to be incomplete or malfunction while using the program,
the program displays an error message and stops running if necessary.
## How Can It Be Improved ?
+Additional languages can be added to the language selection section, or the language prompt section can be removed entirely. <br>
+The program can be configured to save each password to history after it is generated. <br>
+An interface can be added to make the program easier to understand and use. <br>
+Password security can be enhanced with an algorithm that checks the reliability level of the generated password.
